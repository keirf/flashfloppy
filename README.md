## Redistribution

Most code is public domain; the rest is MIT/BSD (see the
[COPYING](COPYING) file).

The source code, and all binary releases, are freely redistributable
in any form. Because FlashFloppy includes third-party code under
MIT/BSD license, you should include or link to the [COPYING](COPYING)
file in any redistribution.

This means, for example, you are free to sell and profit from Gotek
devices programmed with a binary release of FlashFloppy. However **at
a minimum** you should incorporate or link to the [COPYING](COPYING)
file on your selling page. For example:
- FlashFloppy is free software. For more information see the
  [license](COPYING).
