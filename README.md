## Donations

FlashFloppy is a labour of love: working on it takes a **lot** of time
and effort. Although it is [Free Software](Redistribution) and
a pet project of mine, beer & coffee tokens will fuel me in the
push onwards and upwards!

For further information please see the [**Donations page**][Donations].

## Redistribution

Most code is public domain; the rest is MIT/BSD or Open Source friendly
(see the [COPYING](COPYING) file).

The source code, and all binary releases, are freely redistributable
in any form. Because FlashFloppy includes third-party code, you should
include or link to the [COPYING](COPYING) file in any redistribution.

This means, for example, you are free to sell and profit from Gotek
devices programmed with a binary release of FlashFloppy. However **at
a minimum** you should incorporate or link to the [COPYING](COPYING)
file on your selling page. For example:
- FlashFloppy is free software. For more information see the
