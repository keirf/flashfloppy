** FlashFloppy Release Notes

************************************

** v0.6.3a - 18 September 2017
 - Remove Amiga AUTOBOOT.HFE and config files from the distribution.
   The HxC original files work fine, so forking is unnecessary.
 - Resync index pulse after write handling: this dramatically
   speeds up FAT filesystem access in the AUTOBOOT file selectors.
 - Reorganise and update the documentation.

** v0.6.2a - 13 September 2017
 - Prettier 7x16 'narrow' LED font (Kingstener)
 - Remember last-selected slot in no-config mode (LASTDISK.IDX file
   must exist).
 - Ignore glitches on SIDE-select signal (fix for Eric Gustafson's A3000)
 - Various fixes for file selector on Atari ST and Amstard CPC
 - Suppress index pulse when writing to USB stick. Makes slow writes
   more reliable (avoids timeouts on the host).
 - Optimised memory copying and clearing

** v0.6.1a - 31 August 2017
 - Support 2-digit LED display
 - Suppress LCD update of side number when another drive is selected

** v0.6.0a - 24 August 2017
** PC Interface Support. OLED Fixes & Narrower Font Support.
 - Allow PC Floppy Interface (DSKCHG on pin 34) to be selected via a
   jumper at position JC. Default interface (no jumper at JC) remains
   Shugart, as compatible with many non-PC systems including Amiga.
 - Kingstener: Support narrower 7x16 OLED font. Allows entire display to be
   visible through the 3-digit cutout in the Gotek case. This is a separate
   firmware build, update file is in distribution subfolder alt/.
 - OLED reliability fixes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

** v0.5.0a - 15 August 2017
** Greater stability on A1200 and accelerated Amigas
 - I/O latency reduced on drive select/deselect. Results in more reliable
   drive detection on A1200, with and without accelerator, and on warm
   and cold reboots.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

** v0.4.4a - 14 August 2017
 - Improvements to power-on initialisation: initialise the floppy
   interface earlier, start on cylinder 0, and don't trigger a spurious
   step command

** v0.4.3a - 13 August 2017
 - Fix DSKCHG handling. Should make disk insertion more reliable,
   especially on Amiga with noclick patch.

** v0.4.2a - 11 August 2017
 - More efficient I2C handling for OLED and fix synch during flash
   update process.

** v0.4.1a - 11 August 2017
 - Improve I2C robustness

** v0.4.0a - 10 August 2017
** 128x32 I2C OLED Display support
 - Support for 0.91" I2C OLED (128x32, SSD1306 controller). Connect in
   the same way as a 1602 LCD module, including 4.7k pullups to VCC on
   the SCL and SDA lines.
 - Various optimisations and bug fixes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

** v0.3.2a - 7 August 2017
 - Fix buffer overrun in HFE image handler when cannot read data from
   USB stick fast enough.
 - Update the Amiga AUTOBOOT.HFE with latest changes from upstream,
   and bump version number.

** v0.3.1a - 7 August 2017
 - Fix buffer overflow when copying long filenames in no-config mode.

** v0.3.0a - 6 August 2017
** Config-less & indexed operation
 - Operate with no AUTOBOOT.HFE (requires HXCSDFE.CFG in 'indexed
   mode'): files must be called DSKA0000.HFE, DSKA0001.HFE, and so
   on. ADF images are also supported.
 - Operate with no HXCSDFE.CFG! Buttons will cycle through all valid
   images in the USB root folder.
 - Step-pulse speaker is supported on output JB. Recommend buffering
   through an NPN transistor unless using a piezo speaker (high
   resistance).
 - Long filenames scroll on the 1602 LCD
 - LCD backlight timer, scroll speed, and step speaker volume all
   configured via HXCSDFE.CFG (when available)
 - Hack workaround for X-Copy problems. Verified writes/copies are now
   reliable!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

** v0.2.1a - 26 July 2017
** Fixes for LCD handling
 - More reliable startup
 - Fix crashes and deadlocks in operation
 - More efficient command transmission (one I2C transaction for
   successive commands)
 - Support 0x38-0x3F I2C addresses

** v0.2.a - 25 July 2017
** 1602 LCD + Drive Logic Fixes
 - 1602 LCD handling: Will recognise a 1602 LCD with "I2C backpack" as
   used (and connected) for the usual "HxC LCD mod". Does not yet
   scroll long filenames, this will be added shortly.
 - Drive Logic: Will now play nicely in multi-drive systems and make
   AmigaDOS much less confused (no more DF1-3:BAD type messages!)
 - The bootloader is also modified to talk to the 1602 LCD: if you
   want this feature then you must also update the bootloader by doing
   a full serial or USB/DFU flash of the main HEX file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

** v0.1a - 21 July 2017
** Initial release
 - Works only as sole drive in a host system (eg disconnect external
   drives!)
