## IMG.CFG: Example FlashFloppy Geometry Configuration File for Raw IMG Images

# Supports tagged IMG/IMA raw image files with self-identifying geometry.

# If you wish to use this feature, your IMG.CFG must be placed in the
# root folder or FF/ subfolder of your USB drive.
# NOTE: If FF/ exists, IMG.CFG must reside there, not the root folder.

# A badly-defined section (eg. undefined mandatory parameters) may result in
# error 31 (Bad Image).

## TAG in square brackets.
## Format: [<tagname>][::<filesize>]
## Matching Rules:
##  1. <tagname> matches images of the form *.<tagname>.{img,ima,dsk}
##  2. Missing (empty) tagname matches any *.{img,ima,dsk} which is untagged
##     or does not match any other defined tag.
##  3. Tagnames and their matches are NOT case sensitive.
##  4. <filesize>, if specified, must exactly match the image filesize.
##  5. If an image matches no tag, FlashFloppy uses normal geometry
##     auto-detection based on the host= setting in FF.CFG.

# [dsdd80::737280] matches images with names of the form *.dsdd80.{img,ima,dsk}
# and with size exactly 720kB (737280 bytes).

## DISK-SCOPE PARAMETERS
# Apply to the whole disk image. Cannot appear in a @tracks sub-section.

# Mandatory: Number of cylinders (1-254).
cyls = 80

# Mandatory: Number of heads (1-2).
heads = 2

# Image file track layout. Default is "interleaved".
# Comma-separated values:
#   sequential:    Sequential cylinder ordering: all side 0, then side 1.
#   interleaved:   Interleaved cylinder ordering: c0s0, c0s1, c1s0, c1s1, ...
#   reverse-sideN: Side-N cylinders are ordered from high to low (N=0,1).
#   sides-swapped: Sides 0 and 1 ordering is swapped in the image file.
#   eg. "sequential,reverse-side1"
# file-layout = interleaved

## TRACK-SCOPE PARAMETERS
# These can vary across tracks. By default they apply to all tracks unless
# preceded by a @tracks declaration.

# tracks = <track-list>
# Specify the tracks that the following track-scope parameters applies to.
# Format:
#  track-list  ::= <track-range>[,<track-list>]
#  track-range ::= <cylinder>[.<head>] | <cylinder>-<cylinder>[.<head>]
#  cylinder    ::= [0-9][0-9]*
#  head        ::= 0|1
# If no head is specified in a track-range, then all heads are assumed.
# Examples:
#  "0-23.1,45.0" specifies head 1 of cyls 0-23 and head 0 of cyl 45.
#  "27-33" specifies all heads of cyls 27-33.

# Number of sectors per track (0-256). Default is 0.
secs = 9

# Bytes per sector (128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192).
# Mandatory if @secs is non-zero.
bps = 512

# ID of first sector on each track (0-255). Default is 1.
# Numbers may be expressed in hexadecimal with 0x prefix (eg. 0xab).
# id = 1

# Head number for all sectors on this track (auto|0|1). Default is auto.
#     auto = use physical drive head number
# h = auto

# Recording mode (fm | mfm). Default is mfm.
# mode = mfm

# Sector interleave. Default is 1:1 (no interleave).
# interleave = 1

# Sector skew per cylinders. Default is 0 (no skew).
# cskew = 0

# Sector skew per head. Default is 0 (no skew).
# hskew = 0

# Rotational RPM. Default is 300.
# rpm = 300

# Post-Data Gap (auto|0-255). Default is auto.
#     auto = based on recording mode and sector size.
# gap3 = auto

# Post-Index Gap (auto|0-255). Default is auto.
#     auto = based on recording mode and sector size.
# gap4a = auto

# Index Address Mark (yes | no). Default is yes.
# iam = yes

# Data rate in kHz (kbit/s) (eg. MFM DD = 250). Default is 0.
#           0 = based on recording mode and size of track.
# rate = 0

# Flex format is double-density but with single-density (FM) cylinder 0.

# specifying head 1 track formats: with sector @id following on from head 0,
